me, by the minute

10:33pm: start

10:45pm: reread document, creation of all default classes (project requirement #9)

10:45pm: understand that RunProject1 -> RosterManager -> everything else

10:57pm: decide that I need to know java more, start to read ppts. Start with ppt1

10:59pm: have read ppt1, start with ppt2

11:16pm: have read ppt2, valuable information with strings for last 5 pages; start with ppt3

11:18pm: have read ppt3, mostly conceptual and not immediately relevant. start with ppt4

11:28pm: didnt know about 'extends', 'instanceof' keyword, definitely an important read

11:47pm: been working on, Date and Profile public class is unable to be named due to java conflict, will need to look into

12:01am: am comfortable debugging with IJ. first round of debugging almost complete; im getting this error in Student/Date/Profile: "java: X is not abstract and does not override abstract method compareTo(X) in java.lang.Comparable". First google.

12:08am: yeah i didnt know java's compareTo. buts its very important https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9362642/abstract-compareto-method-not-being-overrided

must override the toString(), equals() and compareTo() methoed, or -2 points each violation. I have no idea what this means.

12:19am: I read that project requirement #6 has all java libaries mentioned in ppt2.

12:21am: okay, this makes Comparable<X> make a lot more sense. I understand "must override the toString(), equals() and compareTo() methoed, or -2 points each violation. I have no idea what this means." moreso now

note the @Override, which is part of ppt4

12:27am: first round of 'debugging' complete, now to start with RosterManager

12:31am: before starting to put in commands into RosterManager, I looked at the Project1TestCases and ExpectedOutput

1:31am: took shower, did chores, back to work

2:20am: made RosterManager string input system, working on adding students now in Roster, which requires grow() first

3:30am grow() implemented,

4:14am: I assume that "You CANNOT change or add instance variables, or -2 points for each violation" implies that you can still add instance methods.

4:18am: added constructors to profile and student.java

6:00am: a lot of progress. a basic, unsorted print is enabled with formatting functions in each java class. Students can be added to the roster, but the addition limitations are not yet implemented. Most importantly, the roster's dynamic size WORKS (took forever)!!
